# Farm-React-Native


To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd Farm
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac     
- npm run web

Run dev server
first:
    install expo app on mobile device 
then in vscode:
- cd Farm
- npx expo start 
    or 'npx expo start --tunnel', if that doesnt work
        need ngrok installed
        execute 'ngrok http 19000'
- scan qr code on mobile device 

or start a virtual device in android studio and select 'a' for open android. 
versions are important here, so review https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
